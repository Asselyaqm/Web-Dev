        <p id="back">Back when I first started writing blog posts I would hammer people with a whole bunch of information and advice. While the information itself was good, it wasn’t interesting. The readers couldn’t develop a relationship with the posts and my audience didn’t grow for months. Luckily, I received an email from one of the readers which essentially changed the way I went about writing. It told me one important thing and that was that I needed to include personal stories within my posts. Ever since I have experienced much higher engagement with the blog posts I write.</p>
